<h1>Import a model from a database</h1>
<br>
This page describes how to import a model from a database.<br>
<br>
To import a model from a database, you can access the <b><em>File / Import / Import model from database</em></b> menu option of Archi, or if no model exist in Archi, right-click on model's tree area and select the <b><em>Import model from database</em></b> context menu option.<br>
<h2 id="graphical_interface">The graphical interface</h2>
As every window of the database plugin, the import window is split in 5 zones:
<ul>
  <li>The left zone shows the plugin's logo and the list of actions.</li>
  <li>The right hand-side of the import window is split in 3 zones:
  <ul>
    <li>The database selection</li>
    <li>The models</li>
    <li>The versions of the selected model</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="database_selection">The database selection</h3>
This section allows to select the database from where the model should be imported. The databases are presented in the order defined on the preference page.<br>
<br>
The "set preferences" button allows to directly open the preference page to update the database list or set preferences.<br>  
<br>
Please note that the Neo4j databases are not presented here as the plugin uniquely allows exports to Neo4j databases.
<br> 
<h3 id="models">The models</h3>
The models that are found in the database are presented in alphabetical order. A filter allows to limit the list to models having the specified string in their name (case insensitive). You may use the percent sign (%) as a wildcard.
<br>
<h3 id="database_selection">The versions of the selected model</h3>
Once you select a model, the versions of the selected model are displayed.<br>
<br>
Once on select a version, it's name, purpose and release note are displayed.<br>
<br>
<h2>Importing a model</h2>
It is possible to import a model by a double-click on the desired version, or by a simple click on the "<b><em>Import</em></b>" button:
<ul>
   <li>When a numbered version is selected, the plugin imports the version <u><b>as it was</b></u> when it has been exported. This means that any update done after the export on the model components, through other models, are not taken in account.</li>
   <li>When the special "<b><em>latest version</em></b>" version is selected, the plugin imports the <u><b>latest version</b></u> of all the model components, even if they've been updated through other models.</li>
</ul>

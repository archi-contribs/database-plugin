<h1 style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Database structure</h1>
<br>
This page describes the export of a model in a database.<br>
<img class="image" src="../img/export-gui.png"><br>
<br>
<h3 id="1" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">1. The graphical interface</h3>
The right hand-side of the export window is split in 3 zones:
<ul>
   <li>The database selection</li>
   <li>The versions of the model</li>
   <li>The model's components</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4 id="1.1" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">1.1 The database selection</h4>
This section allows to select the database where the model should be exported. The databases are presented in the order defined on the preference page.<br>
<br>
The "set preferences" button allows to directly open the preference page to update the database list or set preferences.<br>  
<br>
<h4 id="1.2" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">1.2 The versions of the model</h4>
This section lists the versions of the model that already exist in the database.<br>
<br>
The "Now" line represents the version that will be exported in the database. It allows to change the model name and purpose, but also to set a release note.<br>
<br> 
<h4 id="1.3" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">1.3 The model's components</h4>
This section lists how many components are present in your model.<br>
<br>
The plugin maintain several versions of the model and all of its components:
<ul>
   <li><b>Current version</b>: means as it is now (as it is shown in Archi)</li>
   <li><b>Initial version</b>: means as it was when it has been imported from the database, or as it is in the latest database version if the model has been loaded from an Archimate file.</li>
   <li><b>Database version<b></b></b>: means as it is in the database. As the database keeps the whole history (i.e. all the old versions), we are often talking about the latest database version which means the latest version stored in the database.</li>
</ul>
If the "compare model to the database before export" option is set on the preference page, or if one clicks on the "Compare model to the database" button, then the plugin compares all the model's components between the current version and the database version.<br>
<br>
<h3 id="2" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">2. The export process</h3>
The first action of the plugin is to determine a point in time that will be used to determine what needs to be exported to the database:
<ul>
   <li>If the model is being exported to the same database it has been imported from, then this point in time is when the model has been imported,</li>
   <li>If the model is being exported to a different database, or if the model has been loaded from an Archimate file, then this point is time is when the model has been exported forthe mast time in the database.</li> 
</ul>
</body>

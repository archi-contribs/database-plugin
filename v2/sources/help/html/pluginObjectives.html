<h1 style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Plugin's objectives</h1>
The main objective of the database plugin, as its name states, is to use a <b>database</b> as a central <b>model repository</b>.<br>
<br>
The key functionalities are: 
<ul>
   <li>Export to (and import back) models from a SQL database (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostGreSQL, and SQLite are supported so far)</li>
   <li>Export elements and relationships to a graph database (Neo4j) to ease impact analysis</li>
   <li>Version the models and all their components:<ul>
      <li style="circle">Keeps a trace of who does what</li>
      <li style="circle">Allows to roll back any model or component to any point in time</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>Allows several people to work on the dame model at the same time<ul>
      <li style="circle">During export, the updates done by other people are imported,</li>
      <li style="circle">All the conflicts are detected and presented to the user for manual resolution.</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>Allow to share components between models (all the updates done on those components through one model will be visible in all the models)</li>
</ul>
